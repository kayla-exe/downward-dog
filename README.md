## Design

### Imagery
The imagery used on the Spirit Yoga site is very important to the overall experience of the user. A yoga class and group exercise imagery are used consistently throughout. This gives the sense of friendliness if the user was to join the class and is intended to invoke a sense of acceptance in the user.

### Colours
The colour scheme of the website is white and blue. A dark grey font is used which has a good contrast with the light blue and white backgrounds making it easy to read. 

### Fonts
I chose to use the font Montserrat for the entire site. This font was imported via [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/). Sans serif was selected as a back-up font, in case for any reason the main font isn't being imported into the site correctly.

## Features
- ### Navigation

    - The fully responsive navigation bar includes links to the Logo, Home, About, Why Us?, and Sign Up sections of the same page.
    - The navigation bar becomes a drop-down navigation bar on mobile screens.
    - The navigation bar has a fixed position so that it remains visible at the top of the page as the user navigates through the individual sections. 
    - A drop shadow was applied to the navigation bar to make it more prominent against the hero image.
    - This section allows the user to easily navigate through the site to find content without having to scroll back up to the top of the page.
